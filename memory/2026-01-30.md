## Model Governor & Adaptive Intelligence
- **Strict Quota-First Rule**: NEVER attempt to switch to a model with 0% remaining quota. Quota verification is the absolute prerequisite for any tier jump.
- **Task-Volume Driven**: Automatically evaluate input tokens to determine the required intelligence tier (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH).
- **Auto-Escalation**: If task complexity is high AND higher-tier models have active quota, the system MUST automatically switch to the most appropriate high-performance model.
- **Safe Degradation**: If high-tier models are exhausted, the system must automatically degrade to the most capable "surviving" model to maintain operational continuity without errors.

## Polymarket Bot V3.1
- **Price Sensitivity**: Safety margin set at $49.8 from Strike.
- **Signal Filtering**: OBI (Order Book Imbalance) is the primary filter to avoid low-liquidity/fake breakouts.
- **Execution**: Dry-run mode active by default unless explicitly enabled.
